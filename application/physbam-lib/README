This is the original PhysBAM library. And CMake scripts and external libraries are included here.
I expect, in the best case, we will not touch any part of it. It is PhysBAM's philosophy that developer can write water simulation application using the API. But I expect that we might override some classes of the PhysBAM library.
So, the header files in "Public_Library" folder should be visable to users for writing Nimbus embedded water simulation applicaiton.
# [TODO:quhang] Fix the CMake compiling to support external compiling in "physbam_app" folder.

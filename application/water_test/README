This directory should contain a water simulation in the job-data form as
expected by Nimbus scheduler. To get started, we will have 4 kinds of jobs:
1. a for loop job to generate more jobs (for_job)
2. all functions before advection (before_adv_job_x)
3. advection (adv_job_x)
4. all functions after advection (after_adv_job_x)

Here, x is used to distinguish different jobs that may be operating on
different data.

NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- TODO: Need to combine Nimbus Makefile and PhysBAM CMake file.
- Advection of velocity finally needs only grid, face velocity, ghost velocity
  and dt. Boundary and time are not needed.
- There is only one mac grid, that does not change over time, and is the same
  for all processes. It contains the counts and domain of the grid for the
  simulation program. Each process can locally maintain a copy of this mac
  grid.

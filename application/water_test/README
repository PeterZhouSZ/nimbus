This code requires physbam-lib code to be built first. To compile the source
(release version)
make and change directory to Build/Release within this folder. Use ccmake to
then generate the makefile (ccmake ../..). The generated make file can then be
used to build the code. You will need a minimum of 2.8.7 CMake version to build
the Makefile.

This directory should contain a water simulation in the job-data form as
expected by Nimbus scheduler. To get started, we will have 4 kinds of jobs:
1. a for loop job to generate more jobs (for_job)
2. all functions before advection (before_adv_job_x)
3. advection (adv_job_x)
4. all functions after advection (after_adv_job_x)

Here, x is used to distinguish different jobs that may be operating on
different data.

NOTES (Chinmayee)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- TODO: Need to combine Nimbus Makefile and PhysBAM CMake file.
- TODO: Synchronization??
- TODO: Do we need to keep rigid bodies in water simulation?
- TODO: Perform decomposition for all other parts apart from velocity advection
  too.
- TODO: Combine Grid and MPIGrid.
- TODO: Figure out how to construct the data map.
- Advection of velocity finally needs only grid, face velocity, ghost velocity
  and dt. Boundary and time are not needed.
- Mac grid, once constructed and initialized by each processor, does not change
  over time with the progress of simulation. It provides the local grid view to
  each processor.

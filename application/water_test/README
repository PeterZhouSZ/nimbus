This code requires physbam-lib code to be built first. To compile the source
(release version)
make and change directory to Build/Release within this folder. Use ccmake to
then generate the makefile (ccmake ../..). The generated make file can then be
used to build the code. You will need a minimum of 2.8.7 CMake version to build
the Makefile.

This directory should contain a water simulation in the job-data form as
expected by Nimbus scheduler. To get started, we will have 4 kinds of jobs:
1. a for loop job to generate more jobs (for_job)
2. all functions before advection (before_adv_job_x)
3. advection (adv_job_x)
4. all functions after advection (after_adv_job_x)

Here, x is used to distinguish different jobs that may be operating on
different data.

NOTES (Chinmayee)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Need to set_levelset_callback correctly at the beginning of every job, for
  NonAdvData particle_levelset_evolution, since there is a callback.
- Need to set NonAdvData and FaceArray at the beginning of every job, for 
  WaterDriver : for the levelset callback functions get_levelset_velocity,
  adjust_particle_for_domain_boundaries, adjust_particle_for_objects as they
  are inherited from parent class and have a fixed signature.
- I/O & logging will work correctly only as long as we have just one worker.
  Need to fix this when we have multiple workers.
- Synchronization??
- Perform decomposition for all other parts apart from velocity advection too.
- Figure out how to construct the data map.

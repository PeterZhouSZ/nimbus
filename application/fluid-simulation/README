This directory includes a running version of PhysBAM fluid simulation.
It is compiled to a dynamic library. By callling certain functions declared in "public" directory,
you can run a fluid simulation.
Since PhysBAM library is compiled to a static library now, this dynamic library does not depend on
PhysBAM library at runtime.
Now, the simulation is only broken up to two parts: do initialization and then run it.
Better breaking up will come soon.
A proposal is break the program into four jobs and an application initialization job(or not a job?).
(1) A job that constructs all the jobs needed in a substep if that substep is needed.
(2) All the work in a substep happening before advection.
(3) All the work in a substep happening in advection(maybe many job instances).
(4) All the work in a substep happening after advection.

This folder hold the source files related to physbam simulations. The file are
structured as follows:

  > physbam-lib/ 
    The physbam core librray. To run any standalone physbam application or
    against nimbus, you need to first build the librray. Refer to the README in
    the subfolder on how to build the librray.

  > physbam-app/ 
    Physbam standalone applications. This folder has water and smoke simulation
    as well as applications to view the simulation results. To build the
    applications refer to the README file the subfolder.

  > water/ 
    The physbam water simulation bundle that runs againt nimbus. To make the
    shared librray refrer to the README file in the subfolder.
    
  > smoke/ 
    The physbam smoke simulation bundle that runs againt nimbus. To make the
    shared librray refrer to the README file in the subfolder.

Makefile
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Makefile in this folder is meant to make the building process of the
physbam applications against nimbus, easier. For detailed instructions refer to
each subfolder README file for building directives.  The instructions in each
subfolder use ccmakei (gui for cmake), however the Makefile here uses cmake
directly.  For exaxmple you can directly set options and generate the Makefile
using cmake for the physbam librray as follows:

  $ cd physbam-lib/Public_Library
  $ mkdir -p Build/Release
	$ cd Build/Release
  $ cmake -D PHYSBAM_USE_OPENMPI=ON -D PHYSBAM_USE_LAMMPI=OFF ../.. 

To show and check the oprions:

  $ cmake -LH ../..

** NOTE: to make the core library, applications, and shared librraies for
nimbus in the DEBUG mode, replace "Release" with "Debug" in all directives. For
example instead of creating the path "Buil/Release", create "Build/Debug", etc.
Also, note that the generated ecexutable/library name may differ when compiled
in debug mode (e.g. Water vs Water-debug).


The Makefile has following functionalities:

  > make physbam-lib[-debug]
    build the physbam core librray with openmpi active.

  > make water-physbam[-debug]
    builds the stanalone physbam water application executable.

  > make water-nimbus[-debug]
    builds the physbam water application shared library that works againsts
    nimbus worker.

  > make opengl_3d
    builds the physbam app to view output of simulations.

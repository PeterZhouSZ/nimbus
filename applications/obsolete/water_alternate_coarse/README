To build the distributed PhysBAM fluid simulation application library for
Nimbus:

1) Build code in physbam-lib. 
     - Follow the instructions in applications/physbam-lib/README.

3) Make the Build/Release directory within this folder.
     - mkdir -p Build/Release

4) From the Release directory, generate the Makefile with ccmake. This
   requires CMake version >= 2.8.7.
     - cd Build/Release
     - ccmake ../.. 

5) Build the water test application with the generated Makefile.
     - make

Note: Can alternatively build a debug version by replacing Release with Debug
(Build/Debug).

Note: On Mac, you should have g++-4.5 in /usr/local/bin for this make setup to
work.

Troubleshooting:

Step 4: The ccmake prompt should have 3 simple options. If there is a set of full 
PhysBAM options and a build of "water_alternate_coarse" then change the build 
to "Release".

Notes:
------

In order to chage scale/ number of frames/ simulation parameters, change the
constants in app_utils.h and rebuild the code. Will add support for command
line arguments later.

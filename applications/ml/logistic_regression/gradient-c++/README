The gradient operation in Logistic regression program written in C++. This
code runs the operations serially on a single node. It helps determining the
bottomline speed of the C++ without having the nimbus runtime overhead involved.

Usage:
Gradient Program Options:
  -h [ --help ]                produce help message
  -d [ --dimension ] arg (=10) dimension of the sample vectors
  -i [ --iteration ] arg (=10) number of iterations
  --sn arg (=1)                number of samples in Million


Makefile options:
    $ make                to build
    $ make run            to run the example with some default arguments
    $ make run-par        to run the example one process per each core in parallel
    $ make clean          clean generated object and executable files

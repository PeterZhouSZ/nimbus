To activate profiling via memory allocation interposition:

1) The interposition routines must be compiled into a shared library.

   cd ../cloud/src/nimbus/profiler

   gcc -O3 -fPIC -I/opt/local/include -I/usr/local/include -I..  -Wall -o interpose_malloc.so -shared interpose_malloc.cc -lm -lstdc++ -L../ -lnimbus

   ** Perform when setting up Amazon AMI

2) When running the worker, the following environment variables should be set before the worker is launched.

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="../../"  --> Not sure if setting this environment variable is necessary.
   export LD_PRELOAD="../../profiler/interpose_malloc.so"

   ** Add to run_worker() in ../cloud/src/test/ec2/water_multiple/utils.py 

Note: After execution, the environment variables can be unset by issuing: 
      
      unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      unset LD_PRELOAD

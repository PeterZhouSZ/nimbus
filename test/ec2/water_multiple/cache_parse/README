-----------------------------------

To parse and plot cache times, use the bash script as
./parse_plot_cache_times.sh <num_workers>. This assumes that outputs for
workers are in ../output/.

To separately parse each file, use ./parse_cache_times.py -i <input_file> -o
<output_file>.

Plots can be generated using plot_cache_times.py. This script expects files to
be named *_parse.txt, where * is a number, and it expects 2 arguments giving a
range of workers. So to generate plots for files named 1_parse.txt to
8_parse.txt, call ./plot_cache_times.py 1 8. It also assumes 8 threads per
worker (divides the total times by 8 to plot average). This variable is at the
top of the file, and can be changed for a different number of threads.

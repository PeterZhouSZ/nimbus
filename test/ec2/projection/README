Test the speedup of projection optimization. It is tested over EC2 c3.2xlarge.
The result that Nimbus projection seems to take less time than PhysBAM is probably because PhysBAM runs floodfill algorithm, and its running time includes synchronization overhead.
Both Nimbus and PhysBAM are configured to run 40 projection iterations at most. The faster convergence speed brought by floodfill algorithms is not decreasing running time.

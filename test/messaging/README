This appliction tests whether clients and servers are able
to exchange Nimbus commands properly. It tests the marshalling
and unmarshalling of messages as well as the ability of the
SchedulerClient and SchedulerServer classes to process and
parse them.

To test, compile the two applications my invoking make.
Then, start a server with ./server. Next, start a client
with ./client.

In a correct run of the test, the server should exit and
the client should remain running.

The server will wait for a client to connect. It sends the 
client 50 commands (you can configure how many in 
create_commands.h), after which the client sends 50 commands.
Debugging is primitive now, you just look at the text to see
if they match. If this becomes an issue we can add actual
automated correctness checks.

This is a worker intended to run with the application water_alternate_coarse.

-------------------
Build instructions:
-------------------

1. Build Nimbus.
2. Build application/water_alternate_coarse.
3. Issue make (release)/ make release / make debug.
make will build with release version of water app. To make release, you should
have Build/Release code in application/water_alternate_coarse. To make debug,
you should have Build/Debug in application/water_alternate_coarse.

----
Run:
----

1. Start scheduler in scheduler_alternate_coarse.
2. Start the worker in this directory.

Note: Right now, you will have to run both scheduler and worker assuming there
is only 1 worker. That means the command line argument to both programs (1. and
2.) should be 1.

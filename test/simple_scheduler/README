====================
**What does this do:
====================

This is a simple scheduler that runs an application over a single worker. It
waits for the first worker to connect, then asks that worker to run the "main"
job of the application. Then, the "main" job of the application (ie.g. 1d-stencil)
would spawn new jobs and define new data objects. Scheduler would create all
data objects on that single worker and runs all the jobs over there. By this
test we are checking following functionalities:

1. The whole abstraction of the system is sound.

2. The scheduler_server and scheduler_client interfaces work properly. They can
exchange the commands through the network.

3. The name mapping in the application works and the job and data tables are
registered properly.

4. Commands are parsed and interpreted as intended.

3. The job and data mappings are sound.

====================
**How to run it:
====================

1. issue make

2. run ./scheduler.sh

3. launch the ./worker.sh from simple_worker directory.


====================
**Expected result:
====================

You should expect to see the following exchange of commands between scheduler
and worker.

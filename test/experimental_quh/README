Experimental code to test the idea of job query.
The indexing database is built up by job_index.cc[h] and variable_region_set.cc[h].
Other classes are mostly for experimenting.

Now the code can dump a graph for the job workflow of projection inner loop:

>> sudo apt-get install graphviz
>> ./draw.sh
